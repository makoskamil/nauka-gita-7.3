        <p>Hey you, out there in the cold<br>
            Getting lonely, getting old<br>
            Can you feel me?<br>
            Hey you, standing in the aisles<br>
            With itchy feet and fading smiles <br>
            Can you feel me? <br>
            Hey you, don't help them to bury the light <br>
            Don't give in without a fight.<br> </p>
