        <p>Hey you, out there in the cold<br>
            Getting lonely, getting old<br>
            Can you feel me?<br>
            Hey you, standing in the aisles<br>
            With itchy feet and fading smiles <br>
            Can you feel me? <br>
            Hey you, don't help them to bury the light <br>
            Don't give in without a fight.<br> </p>
	<p>Hey you, out there on your own <br>
		Sitting naked by the phone <br>
		Would you touch me? <br>
		Hey you, with you ear against the wall <br>
		Waiting for someone to call out <br>
		Would you touch me? <br>
		Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone? <br>
		Open your heart, I'm coming home. <br> </p>
